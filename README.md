# UppASD-tutorial

## About the document

The contents of the UppASD tutorial are edited using the CodeRefinery template sphinx-lesson

https://github.com/coderefinery/sphinx-lesson-template

for use with the sphinx-lesson

https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-lesson/

extension of the Sphinx documentation generator. The tutorial can be rendered on a local
computer to html files and tex files following the instructions in the readme of sphinx-lesson.

The tutorial can also be automatically built with Github actions and deployed to Github pages.
This is how we eventually will web host the tutorial.
