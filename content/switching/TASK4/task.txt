In this task, use the flag 'Initmag 4' and 'restartfile ./restart.DOMAIN.DW' to initialize
the system. Then set 'stt A' and 'jvec jx jy jz' to control the spin polarization direction
of current.Visualize the domain wall motion dynamics of the
system by UppASD GUI, for that you need to set ’do tottraj Y’ to get the spin configuration 
of each sampling step.
