1. use the flag 'damping' to control the 
damping parameter in LLG equation.

Here you still switch the magnetization direction of 
the macrospin from +z to -z direction, compare the switching 
time with damping 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0. Finally, plot the 
average magnetization of z component as a function of time
for system with each damping. 

Keep in mind that the damping value in real materials is 
usually in the order of 1e^⁻3 or 1e^⁻4, here we use huge 
damping to accelerate our simulation.

2. Use the flag ’anisotropy’ combined with an external
file storing the magnetic anisotropy
parameter of system to manipulate the magnetic anisotropy parameter.

Here still switch the magnetization direction of 
macrospin from +z to -z direction, compare the switching 
time with anisotropy K1  -0.02 -0.2 -0.4.
Plot the  average magnetization of z component as a function of time
for system with each magnetic anisotropy.
