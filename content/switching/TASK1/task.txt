In this task, use the flag 'hfield' to control the 
strength as well as the direction of magnetic field.

Here you will switch the magnetization direction of 
a macrospin and bcc Fe  from +z to -z direction, compare the switching 
time with external field -1000 ,-1500 ,-2000, -2500, -3000 Tesla.
Here you can do each simulation in an individual directory,  
like Field-1000, Field-1500 and so on. Finally, plot the 
average magnetization of z component as a function of time
for each magnetic field.

Keep in mind that the external field in this simulation
is incrediblely huge, here we use huge magnetic field to accelerate our simulation. 

You can use different Jij in jfile of bccFe and compare 
whether different set of Jij affects the switching process?

Do you think the switching process of bccFe behaves like a macrospin? Try to explain it 
from the output moment.bccFe100.out.
