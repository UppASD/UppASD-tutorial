Fe in bcc and fcc crystal structures
Collinear magnon spectra and influence of uniaxial anisotropy
This example shows how to calculate the spin wave spectrum of the standard examples Fe bcc and Fe fcc and to understand the influence of the number of atoms per unit cell on the spectra together with the influence of the uniaxial anisotropy.
